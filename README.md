# //BREAK YOUR CHAINS\\

There are two files with different functions. Darkshield prevents teachers from seeing your screen while it is running (it is a battery hog though, make sure your pc is plugged in), and Poshy's Carbon is a total unblocker that completely disables the filter. Both are only intended for FCPS computers with Lightspeed on them. There's also a text file that contains instructions to get proxies.

Warning: I have no idea what the consequences are for using these. If the school takes disciplinary action against you, it is entirely your fault.
Note: even after running carbon, you will not be able to start exe files that you download. You'll still need games websites.
Note 2: carbon doesn't work for some people. If this happens to you, don't panic - just open the "If Carbon Doesn't Work" txt and follow the instructions.
